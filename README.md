# CS50 AI Course Projects

This repository contains my implementations of projects from **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**.  
Projects span search algorithms, knowledge-based systems, probabilistic reasoning, optimization, machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing.

## ðŸ“š Project Index

1. **p0 - Search** (`p0-search/src0/`)  
   Maze solver using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

2. **p1 - Knowledge** (`p1-knowledge/src/`)  
   Logic-based games and reasoning engines (Clue, Mastermind, and Puzzle solvers) using propositional logic and inference.

3. **p2 - Uncertainty** (`p2-uncertainty/src2/`)  
   Probabilistic reasoning projects, including Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Bayesian networks.

4. **p3 - Optimization** (`p3-optimization/src3/`)  
   Local search algorithms (hill climbing, simulated annealing) applied to scheduling and constraint satisfaction problems.

5. **p4 - Learning** (`p4-learning/src4/banknotes/`)  
   Banknote authentication using multiple classifiers (k-NN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression).

6. **p5 - Neural Network** (`p5-neural_network/src5/`)  
   Handwriting recognition with deep neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras.

7. **p6 - Language** (`p6-language/src6/`)  
   Natural Language Processing: word vector similarity using cosine distance, tokenization, and parsing.
